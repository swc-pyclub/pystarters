    "# Using memmap\n",
    "Most of the times you will have to deal with data sets that are to big to fit in RAM. The solution to manipulating those is to use numpy.memmmap. That function gives you a pointer to memory in the hard disk where your data lives but is treated by numpy as a normal array.\n",
    "The thing with memmap arrays is that if you pass them to functions that do array manipulation then numpy will try to load the whole array in RAM. That will crash your computer. So manipulating such arrays needs to be done in parts (think loops). The trick here is to do this as efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random matrix and its covariance. Difficulty 2/5\n",
    "Let's start by setting up the problem. You will understand what the covariance function of numpy does by recreating it and runnign it on small arrays. This will give you an idea of how much slower the naive (loop based) approach is to the highly optimized numpy (vectorized) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a random elements matrix with 1000 rows (the samples) and 100 columns (the dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the covariance of this matrix using numpy.cov\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Time this\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make some pairs of the matrix samples partially correlated<sup>*</sup> with each other. Create 200 such pairs (they should be randomly placed in the matrix but the relative position of the two samples in a pair can be either random or fixed). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Report some covariances of the two matrices that show that on the pairs of samples you have chossen to increase the covariance that has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <sup>*</sup> To get perfect covariance then two samples would have to be identical (i.e. just copy one sample to the place of another). To get partial covariance one sample would have to be a little bit different to the other. That can be achieved by multiplying a copied sample's elements with random numbers that are close to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do not use loops for any of the above. Everything should be achieved with numpy."

While you are developing make sure that the covariance of any small matrix as calculated by np.cov is the same as the one you calculate. Also time both the np.cov function and your function on different size matrices to get a feel of how much worse you are doing and how that difference increases with matrix size. Once you are sure that everything works then run your function on the very large matrix.\n",

    "# Brief intro to Pandas\n",
    "Pandas is a package that makes it very easy to manipulate data sets with different labels. It's main data structures (DataFrame) are closer to excel spreadsheets and data bases than to numpy arrays.

Give me all the voltage timeseries for the trials where the animal was running faster than 3m/s).\n",
